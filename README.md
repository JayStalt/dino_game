#🦖 The Dinosaur Hunter
A retro-inspired dinosaur hunting game built in Unreal Engine 5.

📜 Project Overview
The Dinosaur Hunter is a passion project inspired by the classic Carnivores series (Carnivores, Carnivores 2, and Carnivores: Ice Age).
The goal is to recreate the nostalgic hunting experience with modern tools — simple mechanics, open environments, and thrilling dinosaur encounters — while maintaining a retro aesthetic.

This project is a slow-burn development for portfolio building, learning basic coding, game design, and Unreal Engine workflows.
